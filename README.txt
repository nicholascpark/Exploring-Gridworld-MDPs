How to reproduce the plots in the npark62-analysis.pdf

1. Store all the .py codes and the hiive folder from URL above in the same directory (Ensure this exact hiive package is used since it is privately modified to perform certain other functions.)

2. All of the plots and the table values in the analysis are produced within two files:

- For the gridworld MDP, run: frozen_lake_experiment.py
	-> e.g. python frozen_lake_experiment.py

- For the forest management MDP, run: forest_experiment.py
	-> e.g. python frozen_lake_experiment.py

The various plots and the print output are created by reusing and editing within a certain body of the code so these sections must be commented, uncommented and edited as desired.
